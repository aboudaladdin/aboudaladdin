ðŸ’¬ Hi! I am Abdelrahman, but you can call me Aboud for short.

I have a solid background in developing data-driven applications across various areas, such as physics modeling, financial simulations, and data visualization. Iâ€™ve worked hands-on with both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, turning complex datasets into meaningful insights that drive decisions.

My experience spans data processing and feature engineering to building and deploying solutions for web, desktop, and mobile platforms. Along the way, Iâ€™ve become proficient in popular deep learning tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Some of the exciting projects Iâ€™ve worked on include seismic physics modeling, automated financial trading systems, and creating dashboards for data visualization.

I am passionate about solving challenging problems with innovative solutions. Beyond my machine learning expertise, I also have skills in embedded systems development and 3D graphics programming.
